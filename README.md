# cutups-and-text
Here's the code I've made to try several automated cut-ups (and other similar techniques).

In `scrapenpr.py` I basically scrape NPR, analyse the sentiment of each of the individual segments and rearrange them from saddest to happiest. The result shows the ridiculousness of modern media and (IMHO) is a fun read (if kept short).
